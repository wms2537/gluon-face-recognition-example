# gluon-face-recognition-example
Face recognition based on mxnet, gluoncv and gluonfr

This is an example of face recognition using mxnet and gluon. Current implementation uses arcface for feature extraction and a 2-layer mlp for classification.

Models are trained with [gluonfr](https://github.com/THUFutureLab/gluon-face)
